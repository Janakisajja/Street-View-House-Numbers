# Street-View-House-Numbers
The Street View House Numbers Dataset contains 32-by-32 RGB images centered around a single digit of a house number appearing in Google Street View. Many of the images do contain some distractors at the sides. It consists of 10 classes, 1 for each digit. Digit '1' has label 0, '9' has label 8 and '0' has label 9. Your goal is to build a model that recognizes the correct digit.
